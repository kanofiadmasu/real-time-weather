# Real Time Weather Dashboard

This is a real time weather dashboard with essential weather app features like, fetching data using an api, and saving and removing data from local storage. This project is not UI focused, rather it is a javascript heavy project that I built to learn more about the Javascript language and its best practices. 

# Features of the app

      1. Accepitng city input and fetching weather data from openweathermap api for that city.
      2. Saving favorite cities in a local storage for persistance.
      3. Dynamic display of weather data.

# Learning Outcomes 

The main purpose of building this project is not to solve a problem, rather it is to learn the most important concepts of the language. I learned a lot of new concepts that I didn't cover while studying them theoretically. And I also learned that building an actual project that uses the things that you will learn is the best way of learning. Here are some of the most important concpets that I learned while building this projet. All this concpets were needed to build this projects and some of the concepts here, I didn't know thme before, while some of them I still know them but I don't understand them proficiently, but building this project helped me understand properly and use this projects for future projects. 

      1. Asynchronous Javascript using(Async/Await)
      2. JS Classes
      3. Local Storage 
      4. Fetching api 
      5. Dynamic display of weather data (DOM Manipulation)
      6. Exception handling
      7. Some of the best practices of Javascript development

## Application of each concpets

      1. Asynchronous javascript(Async/Await): handling weahter data from openeweathermap api
      2. Js classes: for functionalities related to saving data to a local storage
      3. Local storage: For saving favorite cities and Theme prefrences
      4. Fethcing api: used fetch api to retrieve data from the the openwathermap api
      5. Dynamic display: to display data daynamically into the webpage
      6. Exception handling: to handle errors resulted from failed api request 

# Usage 

### You need your own api key and api Url to use it and make it functional, so add your own api key, and api Endpoint
